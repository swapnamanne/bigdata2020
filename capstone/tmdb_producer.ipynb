The painfully shy Nikander (Matti Pellonpää), a garbage man, means the moody Ilona, a supermarket checkout girl. The film tracks their bumbling attempt to establish a lasting relationship: dates that end as soon as they've begun, a romantic getaway where they each retreat to separate hotel rooms, and rare conversations which employ the absolute bare minimum of words. Nikander's best and only friend Melartin (Sakari Kuosmanen), whom the garbage man only recently met through a spell in jail, gives some needed encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's soundtrack is rooted in early rock-and-roll, though unlike later Kaurismaki films where the characters seem to be living in a 1950s bubble, all the action takes place in contemporary Helsinki. I've criticized Kaurismaki's vision of Finland in other films, but <i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> does, in my opinion, accurately depict the collection of gloomy, taciturn binge drinkers that are the Finns.\\r\\n\\r\\n<i>Varjoja paratiisissa</i> is an early work and doesn't show the confidence of later efforts, but it's still quite entertaining, its leads and their struggles extremely charming, and I would recommend the film.

And that title is \"The Imperial March\", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for \"Jaws\" - that legendary score simply titled, \"Main Title (Theme From Jaws)\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with that lil\\' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly \"Movie Date Night\" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema\\'s briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn\\'t believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas\\'s phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I\\'ll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn\\'t suggest there are still a few people out there who haven\\'t. And if you\\'re one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you\\'ll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you\\'ll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊,A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox\\'s historic blockbuster didn\\'t run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn\\'t know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn\\'t just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas\\' baby. Ultimately, though, it\\'s one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it\\'s that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it\\'s an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10,Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is \\r\\n  definitely one of the best films ever made.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Star Wars (1977) it is for sure the most iconic film of all time everything in it is iconic. The direction, the script, the performances in this film are brilliant, all the characters are captivating and well developed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, this is a totally perfect film, I only have praise for it, it is certainly a masterpiece of cinema, and my grade for it is 10\\\\10.'}, {'id': 12, 'imdb_id': 'tt0266543', 'budget': 94000000, 'genre': 'Animation,Family', 'title': 'Finding Nemo', 'overview': \"Nemo, an adventurous young clownfish, is unexpectedly taken from his Great Barrier Reef home to a dentist's office aquarium.

What is your purpose in life? The film teaches that there is such great beauty in the small things in life and that sometimes you need to take a step back to allow yourself to take in the unfiltered beauty in the small things like a plastic bag dancing in the wind, playing with the leaves. The film tells it's audience that the beauty in the small details is much greater than society's typical image of beauty. The prominent rose in the film is a symbol of false, surface beauty; the expensive and romantic flower is amongst almost every single shot in the film reminding us that we need to look beyond the surface beauty of an entity and see the beauty within. This message surrounding beauty is empathised with the inclusion of the rose on the films poster and the tagline, 'look closer' indicating that to see real beauty one must 'look closer', a task that typically requires more thoughtfulness and less immediate facial value judgements that make up the typical image of beauty.\"}, {'id': 15, 'imdb_id': 'tt0033467', 'budget': 839727, 'genre': 'Mystery,Drama', 'title': 'Citizen Kane', 'overview': 'Newspaper magnate, Charles Foster Kane is taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist.

No one knows what it means, and a reporter starts interviewing people Kane knew, to see if they know the meaning of \"Rosebud\". Through flash-backs we get to see Kane\\'s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as I said, I don\\'t agree that it\\'s the greatest movie of all time, however it\\'s great. I love this movie. It\\'s a daring and controversial movie of its time, and it introduced alot of new technices in filmmaking. The acting is superb! Orson Welles as Kane is breathtaking, Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland is great. There\\'s one performance I can hardly stand though and that\\'s Dorothy Comingore\\'s performance as Susan Alexander. Hideous performance to say the least! The writing is amazing, and Welles\\' directing is out-of-this-world!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, great movie (however not the greatest ever made). It\\'s definitly a movie you need to watch!\\r\\n\\r\\nI give it a 9/10,I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70\\'s and 80\\'s, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic \\'Paul Masson\\' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was \\'that voice is amazing\\', then \\'he looks like he\\'d be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus\\', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can tell, I\\'m not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you\\'re any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you\\'re hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It\\'s a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It\\'s not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I\\'m very glad that I finally saw it, and I\\'ll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There\\'s just something really special about it that\\'s hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved \\'Rosebud\\'.

All in all a excellent movie.,A simple enough concept: Guy must save a World (in the Future!) from Evil! by protecting a Magical Macguffin, only in this case it’s a Girl! instead of a Thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s really not a lot of story here. Not a lot of character either. Why waste valuable screen time with such paltry concerns when you can instead have Chris Tucker prancing around as a flamboyant radio host in the most annoying cinematic sci-fi supporting character not created by George Lucas? Instead, the film casts actors who do a fair job of acting simply by being themselves: Bruce Wills is Korben Dallas, a brawny, shoot-first hero who, when the chips are down, is brawny and shoot-firsty. The Magical Girlfriend MacGuffin, Leeloo, is played by Mila Jovovich (in her breakout performance) and some strategically-placed wrappings (the wrappings have had a harder time breaking into more mainstream roles). Ian Holm turns up as the Old Mentor, and filling out the cast is Gary Oldman as the antagonist Zord (in his hammiest role ever).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film seriously rises to the level of made-for-SciFi Channel-original and no higher. The plot is nonsensical, the acting committed but laughable, and the dialogue so stiff you’d think the script pages had been starched.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo where does the film go legitimately wrong? Two main places: first, Besson carries on the proud tradition of French filmmakers doing weird things solely for the sake of being weird. The entire film is filled to the brim with the kind of idiosyncratic touches that I’ve come to expect from that region. Most of the bits don’t work, but I’ll give them credit for keeping things interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second, more serious issue is another that seems to plague genre French directors, and that’s the whole matter being played (largely) for farce. The most successful (creatively) American (sci-fi/)action films are defined in very large part by their villain. This film, like so many other sci-fi/action films I’ve seen from French directors, never establish or maintain an element of power for the villains over the heroes. The villains are painted as clueless, moronic, out of their depth, or outright incompetent. That tradition continues here. What would Star Wars be without Darth Vader? Die Hard without Hans Gruber? Aliens without…uh, aliens?\\r\\n\\r\\nLacking a strong (or even memorable) central villain (we have two: a Gary Oldman so hammy I’m pretty sure Muslims couldn’t work on the film, and the other being a giant planet-size ball of…Pure!Evil! No joke.), the film sacrifices the one shot it had at having some kind of weight or dimension. There’s no sense of danger or peril, no chance that the Hero won’t triumph, and [spoilers!] the day is essentially saved by a Care Bear stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, does what I’ve just said make it bad? Well, yes. Let’s try again. Does that made it unenjoyable? No, and it’s an important distinction to make. The film is an interesting curiosity. After a half-hour of the bizarre, if you can let yourself be swept into its idiosyncratic world you’ll find a perfectly watchable B (or C)-movie. It rankles a bit to think about how much was wasted making dreck this dreck-y, but it’s entertaining dreck.,Ever since I first watched The Fifth Element in the late 90s, I\\'ve been inspired by Gary Oldman\\'s Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I strongly recommend you make the time._,Negative, I am a meat Popsicle.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s 2259 and the Earth is in mortal danger from pure evil. The only hope Earth has is something called the fifth element, which comes in the form of the newly cloned Leeloo. Along with an ex forces cab driver and a priest called Cornellius, Leeloo must piece it together before the end of mankind arrives.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on which side of the fence you sit on, The Fifth Element is either a child fantasy made by an adult, or an adult fantasy made by a child! Here in lies the problem that many critics and movie watchers can\\'t agree on. Just what does Luc Besson\\'s film want to be? Having conceived the concept for his film at a very early age, Besson I think waited until he was comfortable with his adult eyes, and armed with the technological advancements in the late 90s, to realise his vision. With the result being a beautiful piece of science fiction that is, yes- cartoonish in every other frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrucial though is that Besson\\'s futuristic vision of New York dominates proceedings, not even a villain overdrive from Gary Oldman can detract from the colourful vistas that Besson has crafted. The sea has dropped and New York is awash with flying cars, there are no take aways anymore, the Chinese junks fly to your front door to serve you food, how cool is that? Shape shifting aliens are amongst us, who in the context of this Jean-Paul Gautier clothed universe, blend in effortlessly, and opera divas are strangely beautiful and blue creatures. In short, the film is an art direction treat, a feast for the eyes, even as the comedy and action take control in the final third.\\r\\n\\r\\nBruce Willis quickly leaves behind his successful trip to harder edged roles (Twelve Monkeys) to play super cabbie Korben Dallas. Gun toting and with a quip at every turn, this is the Willis that the MTV generation loves and adores. Oldman, for better or worse as Zorg, gives a memorable performance (oh my, is that a Southern American accent?), but it\\'s with Mila Jovovich (Leeloo) that the film gets its acting spurs. A pure revelation, it begs the question on why Jovovich has failed to progress in the acting world? (stop doing tripe like Resident \"will work for food\" Evil films would be a good start).\\r\\n\\r\\nSci-fi fans will obviously get the point that the support cast features Ian Holm (Alien) and Brion James (Blade Runner), which off sets the annoying and painful turn from Chris Tucker as zany, insecure DJ Ruby Rhod (is Besson having a pop at world DJs here I wonder?). To leave us with what? A film that mildly suffers from its director giving way to his heart over his head, but hey baby, it\\'s one groovy and enjoyable romp from start to finish regardless. 8/10'}, {'id': 19, 'imdb_id': 'tt0017136', 'budget': 1300000, 'genre': 'Drama,Science Fiction', 'title': 'Metropolis', 'overview': \"In a futuristic city sharply divided between the working class and the city planners, the son of the city's mastermind falls in love with a working class prophet who predicts the coming of a savior to mediate their differences.\", 'popularity': 17.122, 'release_date': '1927-03-06', 'runtime': 149, 'vote_average': 8.2, 'vote_count': 1592, 'review': 'Metropolis is one of the greatest films ever made.

Think an amalgamation of chop-socky, sexploitation, samurai, spaghetti Westerns, anime and cop shows of years past, and you get the heart of Kill Bill. A film that was so epic in scope it had to be cut into two films. What it lacks in Tarrantino dialogue dynamite it more than makes up for with action and astute visual flair. And it\\'s bloody, very bloody. Thurman is great as the avenging Mamba/The Bride, while the inclusion of Sonny Chiba & Lucy Liu adds a touch of class as QT revels in his East meets West berserker narrative. It could have been trimmed down, particularly in the middle section where Tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal, but Volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003, and most notably it shows Tarrantino to be adept at action directing. His action skills perhaps explains why the script doesn\\'t crackle with the wit and panache of his previous offerings?

Fox, Lucy Liu, ravishing Julie Dreyfus and Michael Madsen appear as various assassins or accomplices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kill Bill” is a creative mish-mash of 60s-70\\'s Bond-isms, Spaghetti Westerns and martial arts flicks, but with modern production values. It sometimes plays like a superhero movie in that The Bride is essentially an anti-superheroine who mows down literally armies of skilled fighters, e.g. the overly drawn-out B&W fight with the Crazy 88s.

Overall this film is absolutely terrible and I don\\'t care what others think, I did not enjoy this film at all.,***The greatest film ever made, but not \"Redux\"***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original \"Apocalypse Now\" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors\\' \"The End.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting narration is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I\\'ll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually an unrecognized genius? General Corman informs Willard: \"He\\'s out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.\" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I\\'ve aged, I\\'ve come to see that I\\'M Col. Kurtz in some ways -- operating \"out there\" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with \\'K,\\' which is no accident:\\r\\n\\r\\nCOL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he\\'s a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he \"loves the smell of napalm in the morning.\" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there\\'s no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he\\'s part of the system and plays the game of war. \\r\\n\\r\\nCOL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It\\'s horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can\\'t have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Redux\" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 53 minutes of material that he originally cut. Very little of the added footage improves the film. Most of it simply drags it down; the rest is either boring and unnecessary or adds a dimension of silliness, not to mention being dubiously scripted and acted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first let down of \"Redux\" is revealed when Captain Willard hooks up with the boat & crew who are to escort him up the river to find Colonel Kurtz. In the original there\\'s a water-skiing scene on the river which dynamically introduces us to the absurdities of every-day life in the field in Nam (with the Rolling Stone\\'s \"Satisfaction\" blaring). In \"Redux\" this part is cut-and-pasted to an hour LATER in the film, horribly muting the original\\'s introduction to life-in-the-field. (I realize WHY Coppola did this -- because the scene was originally intended to be shown AFTER the boat crew steal Kilgore\\'s surfboard -- but he made the right decision to omit the board-theft scene and place the water-skiing scene near the beginning).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) in \"Redux\" is good. The charisma of this air cavalry colonel in all his swaggering glory is perfectly showcased in this brief snippet; but the scene\\'s so brief it\\'s unessential.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour main new sequences definitely DON\\'T work: The scenes involving the theft of Kilgore\\'s surfboard are silly, badly scripted and unnecessary. In fact, they ruin Kilgore\\'s perfect swan song in the original. Moreover these scenes reveal a goofy side to Willard that mar his grim mystique in the original.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe additional bunny sequence during the rain storm is also silly and unnecessary; it\\'s a huge letdown even if your sole desire is to see some more skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest added sequence involves the French plantation mentioned in the 1991 documentary \"Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker\\'s Apocalypse.\" Small bits of this piece work and enrich the film (like the ghostly discovery of the plantation), but on a whole it\\'s too long & talky (where it\\'s impossible to understand the heavily-accented dialogue without subtitles) and simply bogs the film down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final added scene that is unnecessary and arguably reduces the potency of the original film is the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of underwhelming Time magazine articles to the caged Willard. While it could be argued that this sequence destroys the great mystique of Kurtz since it\\'s the FIRST and ONLY time we get to see him CLEARLY in broad daylight, it could also be argued that it\\'s the key scene showing that Kurtz ISN\\'T insane at all, just trapped in the remote jungle with no place to go because he \"got off the boat.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nSo Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film. The new footage of \"Redux\" should\\'ve simply been relegated to the \"deleted scenes\" section of the DVD. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and \"Redux\" proves it.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: Original version: A+ , Redux: A-,It wasn\\'t just insanity and murder, there was enough of that to go around for everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nApocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he\\'s to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola\\'s flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it\\'s what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz\\'s surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro\\'s sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it\\'s arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10'}, {'id': 30, 'imdb_id': 'tt1530535', 'budget': 0, 'genre': 'Animation,Science Fiction', 'title': 'Magnetic Rose', 'overview': 'Koji Morimato’s animated science fiction short story about how the border between reality and illusion on a space station becomes blurry.', 'popularity': 8.883, 'release_date': '1995-12-23', 'runtime': 44, 'vote_average': 4.4, 'vote_count': 99, 'review': ''}, {'id': 31, 'imdb_id': 'tt6266826', 'budget': 0, 'genre': 'Action,Animation,Comedy', 'title': 'Stink Bomb', 'overview': 'Tensai Okamura’s animated action packed short story with lots of humorous elements in which a person transforms into a weapon of mass destruction without themselves being aware.', 'popularity': 3.226, 'release_date': '1995-12-23', 'runtime': 40, 'vote_average': 6.2, 'vote_count': 9, 'review': ''}, {'id': 32, 'imdb_id': 'tt6264824', 'budget': 0, 'genre': 'Animation,History', 'title': 'Cannon Fodder', 'overview': 'Otomo Katsuhiro’s short anime story', 'popularity': 6.632, 'release_date': '1995-12-23', 'runtime': 21, 'vote_average': 6.5, 'vote_count': 12, 'review': ''}, {'id': 33, 'imdb_id': 'tt0105695', 'budget': 14000000, 'genre': 'Western', 'title': 'Unforgiven', 'overview': 'William Munny is a retired, once-ruthless killer turned gentle widower and hog farmer.

A few touching moments where you would think it wasn\\'t possible. Sadistic and brutal fight scenes and then it has Clint Eastwood riding into town for the final terrifying, yet totally satisfying, showdown.\\r\\n \\r\\nHow Al Pacino (The Scent of a Woman) beat Clint to Best Actor in 1993 is a mystery of modern times. Right up there with how The Shawshank Redemption didn\\'t win anything of note in \\'95 but is now regarded as possibly the greatest film of all time by many people.,That\\'s right. I\\'m just a fella now. I ain\\'t no different than anyone else no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he\\'s tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nClint Eastwood signed off from the Western genre with this magnificent 1992 picture, the appropriation and irony of which is in itself a majestic point of reference. After the script had been knocking around for nigh on twenty years (written by Blade Runner scribe David Webb Peoples), Eastwood seized the opportunity to play William Munney and lay bare the mythologies of the Wild West. What is most amazing about Unforgiven\\'s screenplay is how we the audience are firmly on Munney\\'s side, we are, incredibly, influenced by Eastwood\\'s part in the history of the Western. In spite of Munney\\'s obvious murky past (despicable crimes they be), we wait (and hope) for Munney to make a quip and way-lay the bad guys - actually, salivating at the prospect is probably closer to the truth. So it\\'s with enormous credit that Eastwood, and his magnificent cast and crew, manage to fuddle all our respective perceptions of the West and the characters we ourselves have aged with. It\\'s not for nothing that W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek) is the critical character that nobody expected. Beauchamp is a writer of penny pulpy novels that tell of derring-do heroics, gunslingers with a glint in their eye and death dealt like an heroic encore, this gives Unforgiven an excellent sleight of hand, for this West is grim and a destroyer of all illusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nEastwood is greatly served by the actors around him, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman (winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a script he turned down many years before!), Rubinek, Frances Fisher, Anna Thomson, Jaimz Woolvett and an incredible cameo from Richard Harris. Along with Hackman\\'s win for his brutally tough portrayal of Sheriff \"Little Bill\" Daggett, Unforgiven also won Oscars for Eastwood for his clinically tight direction, Best Picture, Best Editing and it was nominated for in another five categories. One of those nominations was for Jack Green\\'s cinematography, which now, in this age of High Definition enhanced cinema, can be seen in all its wonderful glory. The Alberta location is magically transformed into the Western frontier, with the orange and brown hues a real treat for the eyes. Ultimately, though, Unforgiven is a lesson in brilliant film making, across the board it works so well, why? Well because the man at the helm knows this genre so well, having been its sole flag bearer for practically 25 years, and learning from his peers, Eastwood has crafted a thematically complex piece that for all its violence, debunking and melancholy pulse beats, is a film that is as beautiful as it is most assuredly stark, an incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema. 10/10,That\\'s right.

An incredible and true highlight of modern day cinema, regardless of being a genre fan or not. 10/10,This movie directed by Clint Eastward is one of my big three. Three westerns I am willing to watch multiple times when the opportunity arises. (The other two are Once Upon a a Time in the West and The Good the Bad and the Ugly.) All three of those movies are gritty, but not necessarily realistic. The Wild West didn’t see many Gun fights where a gunman  outshoots four or five guys facing  him. And yet, if we saw a movie gunfight where they are shooting pistols at each other and missing all over the place, that might seem unrealistic to us. Movie magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Eastwood plays a former ruthless bad guy who we root for now, and Gene Hackman plays a good guy lawman who is cruel and easy to root against. The dialogue is excellent, such as what Bill Munny says after her shoots a bar owner. There is some humor, as usual for his movies, especially concerning the bragging Schofield. I could go on and on, but you may be one of those lucky ones who hasn’t seen it and still has it to look forward to.'}, {'id': 35, 'imdb_id': 'tt0462538', 'budget': 75000000, 'genre': 'Animation,Comedy,Family', 'title': 'The Simpsons Movie', 'overview': \"After Homer accidentally pollutes the town's water supply, Springfield is encased in a gigantic dome by the EPA and the Simpsons are declared fugitives.\", 'popularity': 71.517, 'release_date': '2007-07-26', 'runtime': 87, 'vote_average': 7.0, 'vote_count': 5748, 'review': \"I've never been particularly invested in _The Simpsons_.

While it might feel \"boring\", it forces you to rethink what philosophical level that a two-hour film can achieve. The focus on questions about life, intelligence, and time, is worth more attention than the sci-fi part (though the special effect of this movie is already way ahead of its time).,The eighth wonder of the world. Easily 30+ viewings since I was a little kid. Nothing new to say here; simply wanted to add another pair of hands to the ocean of applause for my absolute favorite thing, the only indisputably perfect movie, the answer to the question of Is Life Worth Living, Man\\'s greatest achievement, two thousand one a burger-flipping space odyssey,I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where’s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there’s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hadn’t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films — and one of the most controversial — Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity — and folly — of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called “critics” are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there’s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap “the folly”. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably “interpret” the hell out of any movie and “find” whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.'}, {'id': 63, 'imdb_id': 'tt0114746', 'budget': 29500000, 'genre': 'Science Fiction,Thriller,Mystery', 'title': 'Twelve Monkeys', 'overview': \"In the year 2035, convict James Cole reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to discover the origin of a deadly virus that wiped out nearly all of the earth's population and forced the survivors into underground communities.

The difficulty of locating his wife's killer, however, is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of short-term memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.\", 'popularity': 38.262, 'release_date': '2000-10-11', 'runtime': 113, 'vote_average': 8.2, 'vote_count': 10053, 'review': 'We all lie to ourselves to be happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it\\'s one of your key safety devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can\\'t form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard\\'s world. By using a reverse story telling structure it\\'s deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it\\'s trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it\\'s all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard\\'s life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan\\'s know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reverse structure wasn\\'t new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan\\'s musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it\\'s a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10,Excellent. I can\\'t believe I\\'ve finally gotten around to watching all of Christopher Nolan\\'s films (I have \\'The Prestige\\' on DVD, but have yet to see it), but it\\'s been well worth the wait. There are a couple of handful of English-language directors operating right now that I will make sure I watch every single film of, and Nolan has become one of those for me, and rightfully so. A very fine twist on the noir framework.,‘Memento’ is director Christopher Nolan’s tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife’s killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife\\'s killer. He is aided in his investigation by \"Teddy\" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in ‘The Matrix (1999)’ in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film\\'s events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard\\'s investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard’s situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Nolan’s use of handheld camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard’s character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan’s brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself.  The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people’s faith in Christianity or any other religion at that.\\r\\n\\r\\n★★★★★'}, {'id': 78, 'imdb_id': 'tt0083658', 'budget': 28000000, 'genre': 'Science Fiction,Drama,Thriller', 'title': 'Blade Runner', 'overview': 'In the smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles of 2019, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to terminate a quartet of replicants who have escaped to Earth seeking their creator for a way to extend their short life spans.', 'popularity': 38.596, 'release_date': '1982-06-25', 'runtime': 117, 'vote_average': 7.9, 'vote_count': 9573, 'review': '**Planet Noir**\\r\\n\\r\\nI declare _Blade Runner_ the best sci-fi movie of all time.

At the risk of whistling conspiracies and setting off inappropriate vibrations in your slacks, you see, this Ridley K. Dick concoction is going on right now. While we\\'re all transfixed by the endlessly goofy droppings from the web, forever staring down and swiping things on our smarty-pants phones, retweeting selfies of infinitely mirrored  selfies; proliferating at light speed, every aspect of humanity is being replicated, perfected, mechanized, optimized, upgraded, fortified, robofied, Googlized, quantumized, DNA\\'d and NSA\\'d and will soon converge to fall upon and supplant us, and Harrison Ford, despite looking trim for his years, will be too old to stop it!

No, the irony of all ironies is that a world exclusively dominated by self-correcting technocratic cyborgs with zettabytes of artificial intelligence will be a vast improvement. The androids are saving the planet! AHHH, run for your life! Blade Runner is both an expired cautionary tale and emerging utopian fantasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, you knew this already? Very well. Carry on. Enjoy your self-driving cars and virtual nature tours.,Retirement - Replicants - Resplendent. \\r\\n\\r\\nBlade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten. Ridley Scott\\'s follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there\\'s a big egg in it. The egg hatched... \\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, that\\'s by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott\\'s masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick\\'s story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It\\'s a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers... \\r\\n\\r\\nA new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! \\r\\n\\r\\nRidley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film\\'s most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it\\'s forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuite an experience to live in fear, isn\\'t it? That\\'s what it is to be a slave. \\r\\n\\r\\nMood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn\\'t here to perk anyone up, he\\'s here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it\\'s surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it\\'s there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets. \\r\\n\\r\\nTears in the Rain. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis\\' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth\\'s cinematography brings Scott\\'s masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott\\'s Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10,The movie\\'s story didn\\'t do much for me, however I did find parts of it confusing. After watching it I found out that I watched the \"Final Cut\" which has a completely different ending and different implications from the theatrical release. I didn\\'t understand those implications...I needed to look up the ending online. Whether that\\'s because the movie is confusing or I\\'m dumb, I can\\'t say. But my friend I watched it with didn\\'t understand it either.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter looking up the end\\'s meaning, I did find it a bit more satisfying. But the main reason this movie is worth watching is the visuals. Not sure I\\'d watch it again any time soon though.,Some people will say this classic sci-fi \"has nothing to offer other than overrated cult-status\". To that, I would respond, \"it has Rutger Hauer on a rooftop, and that\\'s enough for me\".\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._\\r\\n\\r\\n(3.5 for the Theatrical Cut, 4.0 for the Final Cut),I have only viewed the Final Cut, and judging by reviews elsewhere this is possibly the most complete and satisfying version of them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot truthfully say I am in awe with this film as I found it quite plodding at times. But having said that the visionary aspects, the bleak surrounds, and the air of hopelessness that permeates throughout most of the film is exceptionally well done. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would hazard a guess it wasn\\'t a big success at the box office back in 82/83 chiefly because of the likes of ET, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Return of the Jedi and quite a few other adventure/SF films of the time pushing this film into a dark corner. Another reason could be because it was too slow for those brought up on Star Wars; or just too unengaging for those looking at it from a murder-mystery perspective  (I recall reading that the original version had Ford do a Marlowesque voice over).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn impressive film for all that, with some delightful special effects, and a decent performance from Ford. But of course for me the true delight was Roy\\'s \"Time to Die\" speech at the end.

They are masters of cinematic rhetoric. The unfolding dramatic situations and controlled dialogue are meticulously contrived. Cameron could probably have potted more if it wasn\\'t for his earnest, simplistic messages (rich bad; nature good). All three movies (_Titanic_, _Avatar_, _Avengers_) plot along comfortably then suddenly spike spectacularly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one has ever laid on the cinematic charm and cajolery like Stephen Spielberg. He was by far the craftiest manipulator of action and melodrama there ever was. He was the progenitor of summer blockbusters and all-ages, all-nations spectacles. At his best he had a gift for re-living and realizing that ethereal and irresistible childhood awe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (NOT the sequels... NO, not even the father- son one) was made today, exactly the same way, okay maybe in 3D with updated CGI, it would surely land at the top of the box-office heap. It is essentially the first comic book movie that wasn\\'t a comic book (bespectacled mild-mannered Archaeology prof by day and globe-trotting whip-wielding action hero on sabbatical). _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ (the first and only) is arguably the greatest adventure movie ever cooked up. And we, the abject audience, servile participants of the artifice, were licking its boots. We wanted Spielberg and his Indy to rope us in, reel us into the action, and completely have their way with us. We overlooked the emotional manipulation and contrived trappings because it was a pure freaking joy to watch, a Lucas produced godsend. Harrison Ford was born to play it just as Steven was born to direct it. It\\'s really too bad they had to brand and knock off inferior sequels that, while making oodles of money, tarnished the shine of the unsurpassed prototype.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana Jones was the perfect reluctant action hero on a selfless mission. A whip-snapping, truck-wrangling, swordster-gunning, Nazi- brawling adventurer who was matched only by his headstrong and sassy love interest, one pistol of a gal who could drink any man under the table. Not enough credit has been given to the great Lawrence Kasdan as the writer of this marvellous adventure. The script is as close to perfect as anybody could scribe. Even a dialogue-heavy expository scene (poisoned dates) was infused with a tense element of suspense. Yes, the story was hyper-fictional, completely contrived, shamelessly far-fetched... and altogether delightful. I wasn\\'t expecting much when I went in to watch it back in 1981, but it had me wanting to do do back-flips on the way out. America\\'s own Fab Four, Larry, Steve, Harrison and George, put on an action-adventure clinic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPossibly the only weak spot in the movie is the climax which had our hero and heroine tied to a stake while God, the almighty Mcguffin from the Old Testament, magically wrapped things up for them. \"Don\\'t look\" Indy warns, with his patented crooked grin. Are you kidding? We can\\'t possibly take out eyes off of this. With respect to lost Teddy Bears from space and anti-Nazi machinators, Raiders is Spielbergs greatest achievement. It is one of the finest films ever made, of its or any kind. It is, hands down, my desert island movie.,I think for a lot of people, Raiders is their favourite (x) movie. Be that their favourite adventure movie, favourite \\'80s movie, favourite Spielberg movie, whatever. None of those ring true for me, but it is my favourite Indiana Jones movie. I was a mad fiend for Temple of Doom as a kid, and I\\'ve managed to make multiple teachers put The Last Crusade on in class, so I\\'m quite a fan of the franchise, but Raiders is the most enjoyable to me... I\\'ve never even seen Crystal Skull... So maybe it\\'s dishonest to say I\\'m a fan of the franchise... I\\'m a fan of the trilogy!\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it.

I\\'m sure they were all the rage once upon a time as a classic villain, but it doesn\\'t do much for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarrison Ford, of course, carries the movie, but Karen Allen plays really well with him throughout the movie and is amazing in her own right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf nothing else, Spielberg is able to shoot a powerful atmosphere, and the movie is captivating and engaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s not something I can watch over and over, but when I do watch it I know I\\'m going to get drawn in and have a great time.'}, {'id': 86, 'imdb_id': 'tt0430051', 'budget': 6000000, 'genre': 'Drama,Romance', 'title': 'The Elementary Particles', 'overview': \"Based on Michel Houellebecq's controversial novel, Atomised (aka The Elementary Particles) focuses on Michael and Bruno, two very different half-brothers and their disturbed sexuality.

With honest appraisal I see the only crime that Temple Of Doom can be charged with is is not being as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark. But since few films can match that movie's classic status I find it churlish to do the second film down for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTemple Of Doom is a frenetic roller-coaster ride, full of enough crash bang wallop fit to grace any action adventure in the history of cinema. The set pieces are pure outrageous fun; life raft escape from a crashing plane, mine cart thrill ride & a bridge sequence that is pure boys own brilliance. And while the film finds Spielberg cramming the action with a darkly sinister streak (hence the PG13 rating), we find that the fun still far outweighs any horror that junior viewers might get from certain scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film also finds Ford giving his best performance as Indiana Jones since the plot calls for a more humane Jones. In fine physical shape, his witty interplay with Short Round is coupled with a textured feel of friendship that plays real well up on the screen. Kate Capshaw was always going to struggle to get close to Karen Allen's wonderful turn as Marion Ravenwood in Raiders, for where Marion was feisty and tough, Capshaw's Willie Scott is more scare-d-cat and reliant on Indy's guile to save her from peril, but she does OK and looks gorgeous into the bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a massive hit at the box-office and firmly bought Spielberg the time to then go out and make two dramas in Empire of the Sun (1987) & The Color Purple (1985). He would then return with the third Indiana film to finish what was then a marvellous trilogy; of which Temple Of Doom is the prime piece of meat in the delightful (original) trilogy sandwich. 8.5/10,Decent watch, might watch again, and can only recommend for people who are already big Indiana Jones fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a much cheaper movie than it's prequel, not in budget, but in writing and characters.  With the trade out in female co-leads, Willie is an annoying if not irritating character and the movie might actually be improved if you just edited her out of the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nShort-Round is fun, but not to any degree to go as far as saving the movie.  The atmosphere of the movie is darker than it is funny where it matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not saying it's a bad movie by any means, but I'm not a big Indiana Jones fan and this is definitely the worst of the 4 movies.\"}, {'id': 88, 'imdb_id': 'tt0092890', 'budget': 6000000, 'genre': 'Drama,Music,Romance', 'title': 'Dirty Dancing', 'overview': \"Expecting the usual tedium that accompanies a summer in the Catskills with her family, 17-year-old Frances 'Baby' Houseman is surprised to find herself stepping into the shoes of a professional hoofer—and unexpectedly falling in love.\", 'popularity': 22.364, 'release_date': '1987-08-21', 'runtime': 100, 'vote_average': 7.4, 'vote_count': 4201, 'review': 'This was schmaltzy but decent and could have been a lot worse.

She takes the place of Johnny\\'s dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny.

The two main cast members are a highlight. Swayze was in his prime and Jennifer Grey cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well.

Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby\\'s age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60’s \"Beach\" movies if the male-female relationships were as \"squeaky clean\" as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): \"As a teen back then \\'going all the way\\' wasn\\'t even considered an option.\" The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the \"other side of the tracks.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor\\'s daughter, a minor at that, can\\'t win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there\\'s little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end, a dude who\\'s fornicating with his under-aged daughter and is clearly much older than her as well, although it could be argued that he’s naïve and doesn’t necessarily know they’re having sex already. Flaws like these smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can look past these problems, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that\\'s why it\\'s called \"Dirty Dancing,\" huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie: these scenes are so amped-up and choreographed they shout to the viewer via megaphone: \"This is A MOVIE; it\\'s NOT REAL.\" Nonetheless, Grey\\'s a cutie, Swayze\\'s The Man and the beautiful Appalachian locations are a highlight, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe didn\\'t know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn\\'t have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic). \\r\\n\\r\\nI mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture\\'s trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It\\'s this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn\\'t up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure. \\r\\n\\r\\nMade for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that\\'s a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10,It feels very much a retread of _Raiders_. But, that was a great movie, so it\\'s not exactly as if that\\'s a bad plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._,Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Harrison Ford does a great job as Indiana Jones, it is always good to see Sean Connery get involved, even if he is very passive in the action. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen there is an unfortunate amount of flashback, but it is better than doing an \"Indian Jones: Origin\" movie to explain how he attained his stylish attire and phobia of snakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has a quality female companion, an entertaining side character, but we\\'re back to Nazi\\'s again for villains.  It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi\\'s went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my favorite of the franchise.'}, {'id': 90, 'imdb_id': 'tt0086960', 'budget': 14000000, 'genre': 'Action,Comedy,Crime', 'title': 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'overview': \"Tough-talking Detroit cop Axel Foley heads to the rarified world of Beverly Hills in his beat-up Chevy Nova to investigate a friend's murder, but soon realizes he's stumbled onto something much more complicated.

It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting.\\r\\nAll other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.,They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man\\'s skull with one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nRidley Scott\\'s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I\\'m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe\\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacking Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen\\'s turn here against that of Diane Kruger\\'s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that\\'s inspiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\\'t know man could build such things.\\r\\n\\r\\nDialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men\\'s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10,Ridley Scott\\'s Gladiator is a real masterpiece of its genre. With its unique battle scenes, cinematography, acting and directing. It\\'s a real must-watch.
